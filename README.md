# Predicting-Life-Expectancy

Project Overview
This project aims to predict Life Expectancy based on various health, economic, and social factors using machine learning models. The goal is to use different algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, to analyze the impact of features such as GDP, Schooling, Alcohol consumption, and Infant Mortality on life expectancy. The dataset comes from Kaggle and includes data from different countries across various years.
